MULTI STEP FORM

As the name suggests you're able to nagivate through the form steps, select the options and return to undo them. 

The project's main goals are:

  • Develop my abilities using the technologies HTML, CSS and JS and other technologies due to the difficulties I'll certainly go through.
  • Create a good looking design, mobile first and responsive form.


Good to know: The design and base project has been gotten from FrontEnd Mentor. I'll change things if necessary.
