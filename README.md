##THE PROJECT##

The project's main goals are:

  • Develop my abilities using the technologies HTML, CSS and JS and other technologies due to the difficulties I'll certainly go through.
  • Create a good looking design, mobile first and responsive form.

Timeline:

  • I'll be updating the project as it updates. At first I'll be using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS to pratice. As I learn new technologies and the beckend area I'll create a database to store the information and later on use it on something.

Good to know: The design and base project has been gotten from FrontEnd Mentor. I'll change things if necessary.
